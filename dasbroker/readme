Introduction:
	This is a resource broker for the DAS-3 cluster. It is imlemnted so that jobs are subited to the "best" DAS-e site.

Scripts:
	The archieve also contains scripts to retrieve the WSDL file from the webservice, and to generate the necessary Java code using WSDL2Java. 

	To retrieve the WDSL file, go to the dasbroker directory and  type: 

	   ./scripts/retrieve_wsdl
  
	An Adaptive.wsdl file should now have appeared in the directory.
	Next type: 
   	./scripts/generate_stubs

 	This will generate the webservice stub and Bean classes. They  will appear in the following directories: 
	
	./src/adaptive/beans
   	./src/adaptive/service

	 To use them in your DASBrokerAdaptor, just add the import 
 	statements:

   	import adaptive.beans.*;
   	import adaptive.service.*;


Requrements:
	-Java 1.5 or higer 
	-JavaGAT-1.7.1 

Building a jar:

	By using 'ant', all source code in the 'src' directory will 
	be compiled an a jar file will be created that contains the 
	classes and a special MANIFEST file that is required for the 
	JavaGAT. 
	
	For more information, see the course's webpage:
	
	http://www.cs.vu.nl/~aagapi/c_and_g/

Runing with a JOINC application:
	Either use the run_PrimeMaster or run_SIMMaster. Alternativally you may use the scrip at $GAT_LOCATION/bin/run_grid_app, but make sure that you set the adaptors location:
	
	export DAS_ADAPTOR=dasbroker/jar/DASResourceBrokerAdaptor.jar

	and add the stubs in the classpath 
	
	CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/delphoiStubs.jar
